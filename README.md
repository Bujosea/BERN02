# Generalised Linear Regression

In this project, we will estimate the parameters for a Poisson regression using maximum likelihood. After that, we will generate three samples of data (hypothetical observations) using the parameters previously obtained.

To do this, we will use the data file `bird_count.csv`, which contains bird counts from one site from 1999 to 2012.
